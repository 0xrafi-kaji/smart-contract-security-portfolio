## 🛡️ Audit Philosophy  
I follow a **systematic and adversarial approach** to reviews:  
1. **Scoping** – Understand protocol design & assumptions.  
2. **Reconnaissance** – Explore code base, external docs, dependencies.  
3. **Threat Modeling** – Identify key assets, attack surfaces, and risks.  
4. **Testing** – Write fuzzing, invariant, and unit tests in Foundry.  
5. **Reporting** – Deliver concise and actionable findings.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this portfolio is to provide a transparent and structured overview of the audits, security reviews, experiments, and notes I have conducted. By maintaining this repository, I aim to:

* Demonstrate hands-on auditing capabilities through real-world and practice audits.
* Highlight security-focused methodologies, including scoping, threat modeling, test suite reviews, and deployment analysis.
* Track personal progress as I expand my knowledge of Solidity, EVM-based security, and decentralized finance protocols.
* Share insights, references, and educational materials that may be useful to other auditors, developers, and learners.

---

## Contents

This repository includes:

* **Audit Reports** → Structured findings, executive summaries, and severity classifications from projects I’ve audited.
* **Notes & Methodologies** → Detailed approaches to scoping, vulnerability detection, exploit reproduction, and remediation strategies.
* **Code Reviews** → Annotated Solidity code reviews with inline comments for clarity and learning.
* **Resources** → Curated security references, tooling guides, and best practices in smart contract security.
* **Progress Logs** → Daily/weekly notes to document my learning curve, audit exercises, and key takeaways.

## Tools & Techniques

I actively work with industry-standard tools and frameworks such as **Slither, Echidna, Foundry, MythX, Hardhat, and Tenderly**, while also relying on manual review techniques for in-depth vulnerability detection. Emphasis is placed on recognizing issues like **reentrancy, access control flaws, logic errors, oracle manipulation, and gas optimization concerns**.

---

## Vision

This portfolio is not only a personal learning archive but also a professional showcase. It reflects my dedication to becoming a trusted **Web3 security researcher** who contributes to building a safer blockchain ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to combine structured audits, research, and shared knowledge into a resource that grows over time while strengthening my credibility in the security community.
